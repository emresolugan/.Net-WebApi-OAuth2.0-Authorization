# .Net-WebApi-OAuth2.0-Authorization


This project was written with C# language in .NET framework. In order to build project you must open Bus_Staj.sln file in Visual Studio. 
I used OAuth2.0 authorization in this project so , you can't access to data by link on browser, I suggest you to download POSTMAN that you can watch API activities in this program.

This is web browser's picture so, it seems that after oauth authorization our access is denied..

If you use postman we can see our data..
