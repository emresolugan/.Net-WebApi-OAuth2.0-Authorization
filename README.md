# .Net-WebApi-OAuth2.0-Authorization


This project was written with C# language in .NET framework. In order to build project you must open Bus_Staj.sln file in Visual Studio. 
I used OAuth2.0 authorization in this project so , you can't access to data by link on browser, I suggest you to download POSTMAN that you can watch API activities in this program.
